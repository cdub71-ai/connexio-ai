// Conversation templates based on real client interactions

  deliverabilityTroubleshooting: {
    trigger: ["deliverability", "open rate", "spam", "inbox"],
    response: `I see deliverability challenges come up frequently with clients. Let me walk you through the systematic approach that's worked well:

**Immediate Assessment:**
‚Ä¢ Check your sender reputation (tools like Sender Score)
‚Ä¢ Verify SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are properly set up
‚Ä¢ Review recent bounce and complaint rates

**Quick Wins (implement this week):**
‚Ä¢ Remove all hard bounces from your list immediately
‚Ä¢ Set up authentication if not already done
‚Ä¢ Segment your most engaged subscribers for a test send

**Longer-term strategy:**
‚Ä¢ Implement engagement-based sending (active vs inactive segments)
‚Ä¢ Establish consistent sending patterns
‚Ä¢ Build a sunset policy for inactive subscribers

I've seen this approach improve deliverability by 15-30% for most clients within 30 days. Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these areas?`
  },

  segmentationStrategy: {
    trigger: ["segment", "targeting", "audience", "personalization"],
    response: `Segmentation is where I see the biggest impact for most clients. Here's the proven approach:

**Start with Engagement Segmentation:**
‚Ä¢ Active (opened/clicked in last 30 days)
‚Ä¢ Inactive (no engagement 30-90 days)  
‚Ä¢ Re-engagement candidates (90+ days)

**Then layer in Behavioral:**
‚Ä¢ Purchase history and frequency
‚Ä¢ Website activity and preferences
‚Ä¢ Email engagement patterns

**Pro tip from client experience:** Start with 3-5 segments maximum. I've seen companies try to create 20+ segments right away and it becomes unmanageable.

Most clients see 20-40% improvement in engagement rates just from basic engagement segmentation. What's your current approach to segmentation?`
  },

  automationPlanning: {
    trigger: ["automation", "workflow", "nurture", "drip"],
    response: `Marketing automation is powerful but needs to be implemented strategically. Here's what works:

**High-Impact Workflows to Start With:**
1. Welcome series (highest ROI for most clients)
2. Abandoned cart recovery (if e-commerce)
3. Re-engagement campaigns for inactive subscribers

**Workflow Design Best Practices:**
‚Ä¢ Map the customer journey before building
‚Ä¢ Use behavioral triggers, not just time-based
‚Ä¢ Always include exit criteria and frequency caps
‚Ä¢ Build in A/B testing from the start

**Common Mistake to Avoid:** Don't automate everything at once. I recommend starting with one workflow, optimizing it, then expanding.

What's your primary goal with automation - nurturing leads, customer retention, or something else?`
